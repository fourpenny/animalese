# Animalese
The Jupyter notebooks in this repository are the steps on a journey to create a cute phrase generator trained on dialogue from the Animal Crossing series.

## Notebook Summaries
[Notebook 1](acGenerator.ipynb) - Contains a webscraper to obtain game dialogue from the [Animal Crossing fandom wiki](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Dialogues) and [Nookipedia](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Main_Page) as well as multiple character-based RNNs for simple phrase generation.
